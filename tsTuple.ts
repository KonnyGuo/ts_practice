// In TypeScript, a tuple is a data structure that allows you to store a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements of different types. Unlike arrays, which can store elements of the same type and have a dynamic size, tuples provide a way to specify the types and order of elements at the time of declaration. Think of tuples as a way to represent a fixed structure or record.

// Here's the basic syntax for defining a tuple in TypeScript:
 
let myTuple: [string, number, boolean] = ["Hello", 42, true];

let arr: (string|boolean)[] = ["yes", true]

let rgb: [number, number, number,number?]
let rgba: [number, number, number,number?]
rgb = [0,0,0]
rgba = [255,255,255,0.5]
