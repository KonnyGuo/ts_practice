// In TypeScript, a tuple is a data structure that allows you to store a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements of different types. Unlike arrays, which can store elements of the same type and have a dynamic size, tuples provide a way to specify the types and order of elements at the time of declaration. Think of tuples as a way to represent a fixed structure or record.
// Here's the basic syntax for defining a tuple in TypeScript:
let myTuple = ["Hello", 42, true];
let arr = ["yes", true];
let rgb;
let rgba;
rgb = [0, 0, 0];
rgba = [255, 255, 255, 0.5];
